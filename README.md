# Decentralized Scientific Publishing Powered by Fully Homomorphic Encryption

Imagine a world where scientists can share their groundbreaking research without compromising the privacy of their findings. Our project, **DeSci Publish**, is a decentralized publishing platform that allows researchers to publish FHE-encrypted scientific papers. Using **Zama's Fully Homomorphic Encryption technology**, we ensure that only paying users can decrypt and access the content, revolutionizing how academic publishing operates.

## Addressing the Research Publication Challenge

In the current academic landscape, traditional publishing houses often monopolize the distribution of research, imposing high fees that restrict access to published works. This results in knowledge inequality, where only those with financial resources can access important scientific discoveries. Furthermore, the revenue model typically rewards publishers rather than the authors and peer reviewers. Our platform aims to tackle these pain points by creating a more equitable system.

## How Zama's FHE Powerfully Transforms Publishing

By leveraging **Zama’s open-source libraries**, including **Concrete** and the **zama-fhe SDK**, we implement Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) to protect research data. This technology allows computations to be performed on encrypted data without requiring decryption. Thus, scientific papers can remain confidential while still being processed for access control and royalty distribution. Users can conduct payments and manage subscriptions without ever exposing the actual data, fundamentally changing how academic works are published and accessed.

## Core Functionalities of DeSci Publish

- **FHE Encryption for Papers:** All research papers are encrypted using FHE, allowing only authorized users to access and read the content.
- **Automated Royalty Distribution:** Smart contracts manage payment flows and royalties seamlessly, ensuring fair compensation for authors and peer reviewers.
- **NFT Representation:** Each paper can be represented as an NFT, allowing for transactions and ownership transfers within the blockchain.
- **Subscription Management:** Users can subscribe to works and benefit from a personalized interface to manage their access rights.
- **Decentralized Governance:** The platform encourages community governance to shape future developments and features, enhancing user engagement.

## Technology Stack

- **Zama FHE SDK:** The backbone for confidential computing and FHE.
- **Smart Contract Development:** Implemented with Solidity using Hardhat/Foundry.
- **Frontend Framework:** Built with React for a responsive user experience.
- **Blockchain Framework:** Ethereum for decentralized data management.
- **Database:** IPFS for storing metadata associated with each paper securely.

```

## Installation Steps

To get started with DeSci Publish, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have **Node.js** and **npm** installed on your machine. You can check installation via:

   ```bash
   node -v
   npm -v
   ```

2. Download the project files and navigate into your project directory.

3. Run the following command to install the necessary dependencies, including the Zama FHE libraries:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. After the installation is complete, make sure to configure any environment variables or settings necessary for your setup.

## Building and Running the Project

Once you have set up the project, you can build and run it with the following commands:

1. **Compile the contracts:**

   ```bash
   npx hardhat compile
   ```

2. **Run tests to ensure everything works correctly:**

   ```bash
   npx hardhat test
   ```

3. **Deploy to your local test network:**

   ```bash
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
   ```

4. **Start the development server:**

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

After running the above commands, you should be able to access the application locally and begin interacting with the decentralized publishing platform.

## Sample Code Snippet

Here’s a small code example to demonstrate how a paper is encrypted and stored:

```javascript
const { encryptPaper } = require('./encryptionLibrary');

async function publishPaper(title, content) {
    // Encrypt the paper content using Zama's FHE method
    const encryptedContent = await encryptPaper(content);
    
    // Logic to store encrypted content using smart contracts
    await smartContract.publish({
        title: title,
        content: encryptedContent,
    });

    console.log(`The paper titled "${title}" has been published successfully!`);
}
```
